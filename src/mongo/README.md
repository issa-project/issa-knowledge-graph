This folder provides tools to import three different datasets into MongoDB, that are involved in the the generation the ISSA RDF dataset.

These are the MongoDB collections created:

- Dataset `issa-latest`:
    - `metadata_en`, `metadata_fr`: from agritrop_en.tsv and agritrop_fr.tsv respectively created by the text_corpus\metadata scripts 
    - `fulltext_en`, `fulltext_fr`: from per-article JSON files containing full text created by the text_corpus\full_text scripts 

- Named entities:
    - `entityfishing_en`, `entityfishing_fr`: from JSON files generated by ner\entity-fishing scripts
    - `spotlight_en`, `spotlight_fr`: from JSON files generated by ner\DBpedia-Spotlight

Script `run_import_issa_in_container.sh` is the entry point. 

NOTE: the scripts are run in the contexts of the *mongodb* docker 
TODO: add docker run commands

Uncomment the lines at the end of the `import_issa.sh`script as needed to import datasets.
It loads the datasets and creates derived collections using the `*.js` files.

Script `import-tools.sh` defines functions to load groups of JSON files into MongoDB.
