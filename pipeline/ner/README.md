**WARNINGS:** 
- **We rely on the [pycld2 package](https://github.com/aboSamoor/pycld2) for language detection which currently excludes Windows support.**
- These scripts need refactoring

The scripts depend on the docker containers for *dbpedia-spotlight.en*, *dbpedia-spotlight.fr*, and *entity-fishing*
