# openalex/getTopicsHierarchy

The SPARQL micro-serivce construct a simple SKOS thesaurus of the topics in OpenAlex, together with their sub-fields, fields and domains.

Since the OpenAlex API implements pages, the SPARQL micro-serivce must be invoked sequentially for all the pages. See example invocation in script `_test.sh`.
