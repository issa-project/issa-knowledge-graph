# SDG metadata

This folder provides the scripts to retrieve from http://metadata.un.org/sdg/XXX the RDF description of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), and import it into a new named graph <http://ROOT/graph/sdgs-metadata>.

This information is stored as a reference mainly to get the SDG labels.
It should be invoked once at the first deployement of the pipeline, but it is very unlikely to change.
